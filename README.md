# Prestashop low stock information in product miniature

Prestashop module adding low stock alert to product miniatures. 

Version 1.1.0 - From now it can be transplanted to product additional info in product card (screenshot below). 
Before transplanting I strongly recommend you to disable prestashop built-in low-stock alert by setting "Display remaining quantities when the quantity is lower than" in "Product Settings" to 0.
